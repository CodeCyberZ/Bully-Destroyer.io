                    <h2>About Us</h2>
                    <p>Bully Destroyer is an anti-bullying chatbot designed to help and support victims of bullying anonymously. Victims will not have to worry about their concerns and issues, as we will ensure their anonymity. Our objective is to keep their information private, secure, and confidential. Our system is a chatbot that interacts with users to discuss their concerns. This system will provide initial assistance before they engage in a formal discussion with their school teachers regarding their problems. The system is a simple rule-based chatbot developed to assist users. It has only limited knowledge and functionality since it follows predefined rules and decision trees. Its responses are highly dependent on the users' inputs and requests. Therefore, we are certain that the chatbot cannot completely resolve all of the users' concerns. In that case, we have provided the school's contact information, allowing you to reach out to the school and faculty members for the necessary support. We are dedicated to providing the best quality service possible, ensuring that every user feels heard, supported, and valued.</p>
